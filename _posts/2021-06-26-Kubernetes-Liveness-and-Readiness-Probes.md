Liveness and Readiness probes are used to control the health of an application running inside a Pod’s container. Kubernetes gives you two types of health checks, and it is important to understand the differences between the two, and their uses.


### Liveness probe
Liveness probes let Kubernetes know if your app is alive or dead. If your app is alive, then Kubernetes leaves it alone. If your app is dead, Kubernetes removes the Pod and starts a new one to replace it.

### Readiness probe
Readiness probes are designed to let Kubernetes know when your app is ready to serve traffic. Kubernetes makes sure the readiness probe passes before allowing a service to send traffic to the pod. If a readiness probe starts to fail, Kubernetes stops sending traffic to the pod until it passes.

In this article, we will see how we can have the Liveness & Readiness probe defined and deployed in Kubernetes.

### Step-1: 
app.py is a simple Hello World Python Flask application, here we have defined multiple routes and based on the route, respective messages will be displayed to the end-user.

#### Python Flask Application

~~~
import time
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/liveness')
def healthx():
  time.sleep(2);
  return "<h1><center>Liveness check completed</center><h1>"
  
@app.route('/readiness')
def healthz():
  time.sleep(20);
  return "<h1><center>Readiness check completed</center><h1>"
  
@app.route("/")
def hello():
  return "<h1><center>Hello World app! Version 1</center><h1>"

if __name__ == "__main__":

  app.run(host='0.0.0.0',port=5000)
~~~

### Step-2: 
We will Dockerize the app and push it to a Docker hub repository. The app will listen on port 5000.

#### Dockerfile
~~~
FROM alpine:3.8
RUN mkdir /var/flaskapp
WORKDIR /var/flaskapp
COPY .  .
RUN apk update
RUN apk add python3
RUN pip3 install -r requirement.txt
EXPOSE 5000 
CMD ["python3","app.py"]
~~~

##### requirement.txt
~~~
flask
~~~

I have uploaded this Container Image to docker hub and it is available in sebinxavi/k8s-readiness:v1

### Step-3:
As the app is now ready, we have to write the deployment manifest with LivenessProbe and ReadinessProbe defined along with service resource to deploy it on Kubernetes cluster.  

#### service-nodeport.yml

~~~
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service-nodeport

spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 5000
      nodePort: 30000
      targetPort: 5000
      name: http
  selector:
    app: healthcheck
~~~


#### live-readiness.yml

~~~
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: healthcheck
  labels:
    app: healthcheck
	
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: healthcheck


  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: healthcheck
            
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: healthcheck-pod
          image: sebinxavi/k8s-readiness:v1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5000
		  
		  livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /liveness
              port: 5000
            initialDelaySeconds: 15
            timeoutSeconds: 2
            periodSeconds: 5
            failureThreshold: 2
            
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /readiness
              port: 5000
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            timeoutSeconds: 3
            periodSeconds: 10
            failureThreshold: 3
~~~


- initialDelaySeconds: Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness or readiness probes are initiated.
- periodSeconds: How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. 
- timeoutSeconds: Number of seconds after which the probe times out. 
- failureThreshold: When a probe fails, Kubernetes will try failureThreshold times before giving up. Giving up in case of liveness probe means restarting the container. In case of readiness probe the Pod will be marked Unready.

Deploy the manifest through kubectl apply. Once deployed, I’ve run a --watch command to keep an eye on the deployment. Here’s what it looked like.

You’ll notice that the ready status showed 0/1 for about 49 seconds. Meaning that my container was not in a ready status for 50 seconds until the /readiness page became available through the startup script.

If we access the application service, we can see a successful response once /readiness page became available.

## Summary

Both liveness and readiness probes are used to control the application's health. If the liveness probe fails, the container will be restarted, whereas the readiness probe will stop our application from serving traffic.
